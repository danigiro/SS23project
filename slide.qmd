## What is data processing

When designing an experiment, data are not just passively recorded, but actively constructed so that they are ready to be analysed. 

- excluding data
- transforming variables
- coding data

As a result, raw data do not uniquely give rise to a single data set for analysis but rather to a **multiverse of data sets**. 
And as each data set in this data multiverse an lead to a different statistical result, the data multiverse directly implies a **multiverse of statistical result**

## What is data processing

- Selective reporting without justification: researchers' choices appear to be arbitrary
- This **arbitrariness** is then inherited by the statistical result
- The inevitable arbitrariness in the data and the sensitivity of the result are hidden to the reader
- In the end, it is impossible to evaluate the robustness of the finding

## What is a multiverse analysis 

- Multiverse analysis allows the researchers to perform the analyses of interest **across the whole set of data sets** that could arise from different choices in data processing.

- It is related to the idea of the **garden of forking paths** in data analysis

- It can be performed on large or small datasets, regardless of the **inferential framework** (frequentist or Bayesian), and regardless of the specific way uncertainty is quantified: a p value, an effect size, a confidence interval, or a Bayes factor. 

## Goals 

- Multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices 

- It enhances the transparency in reporting results 

- It helps identifying the key choices that conclusions hinge on, facilitating attempts of replication

-  It helps identifying the level of uncertainty related to the data set, because a pattern of non significant results indicates that the data are not strong enough to draw conclusions

- It reduces the problem of selective reporting, because the fragility of results is made explicit

## How to do it

When setting up an experiment or performing a statistical analysis there are several degrees of freedom. A multiverse analysis consists in 

- identifyig sets of defensible analysis choices
- implementing them 
- reporting the outcomes of all possible choice combinations

## Where to intervene

- Data substitution: which raw datasets to use (collected/simulated) 
- Data processing: how to process the raw data (data transformation, outlier detection)
- Modeling choices: Statistical model setup (distributional alternatives, parameter tuning, multiplicity correction, prior choices, significance levels) 
- Presentation: different ways of presenting analysis outcomes. 

## Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes

- Jung et al. study responses to natural hazards on basis of social science factors

- Severe hurricanes with feminine names causes more fatalities

- Do people judge hurricane risks in the context of gender-based expectations?

- Perception about risk and intensity is associated with sex through the name assigned to the phenomenon 

- Judgment is congruent with the social roles and expectations corresponding to the sex 

## Jung's universe 

- The data: information on 94 hurricanes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) such as number of deaths (deaths), minimum pressure (pressure), wind speed (wind), property damages (damage), severity (category), 11-point femininity scale for the name.

- The processing: exclusion of the two most deadly and the three most damaging instances.  

- The model: poisson regression model with number of deaths as response and femininity, damages, standardized pressure and their interactions with femininity as predictors.

## The multiverse

- Data processing: dichotomize the femininity variable

- Outlier detection:
  
  - damage outlier: 0, 1, 2 or 3 most damage 
  - death oulier: 0, 1 or 2 most deadly

- Model: log-transform linear regession or Poisson regression 

- Covariates choices: choose which covariates and which interactions between them. 

## The `multiverse` package 

- The goal of `multiverse` is to allow users to create a multitude of end-to-end analyses in a concise and easily interpretable manner. 

- It can be used in different environments such as in `RMarkdown` and `RScripts`. 

- `multiverse` takes user declared code, rewrites it into multiple executable `R` code versions each corresponding to an analysis path in the multiverse.

- Several practical examples are provided for different scientific fields.

## Comments

-  A multiverse analysis is highly context specific and subjective

Yes, but it's still less subjective than choosing just one of the possible combinations

-  Do I have to test all possible combinations?

The goal of multiverse analysis is not to test the whole set of possible combinations: the researcher should always justify why she/he wants to test that specific choices.
